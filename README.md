# Techdegree Project 10 - Full Stack Application

Welcome to my 10th and final Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree project!

This project features a React / React Router V6 front end with a Node/Express/Sequelize back end.

To run the project, run "npm start" on the command line in both the client and api directories.

Once running, you can access the client in developer mode in a browser at http://localhost:3000.

Thank you, and feel free to send your comments my way!
